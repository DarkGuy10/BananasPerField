# BananasPerField

Calculating the number of bananas that can fit in a football field in various programming languages.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to determine how many bananas can fit in a football field using different programming languages.

## Variables and Values
To calculate, ensure your variables and values align as follows:

- Banana Length in Inches: 7.5
- Football Field Length in Inches: 3,500

```python
# Python example
banana_length = 7.5
football_field_length = 3500
bananas_per_field_length = football_field_length / banana_length  # Result: 466.67

banana_width = 0.75
football_field_width = 1920
bananas_per_field_width = football_field_width / banana_width # Result: 2,560

banana_football_area = bananas_per_field_length * bananas_per_field_width
print(banana_football_area) # Result: 1,228,800 
```
